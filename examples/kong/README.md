# Kong

Kong is an "Open-source, Microservice & API Management Layer built on top of
NGINX". It is a great example of a real world microservices based application
that can be run with ease on Mantl. To do so, just fill in the $ip, $username,
and $password variables in the deploy.sh script and run it from this directory.
